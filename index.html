            <h3>Part 1.</h3>
            <p>
                Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity To seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment Would you capture it or just let it slip? Yo, His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy There's vomit on his sweater already: Mom's spaghetti He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now The clock's run out, time's up, overâ€”blaow! Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity, oh There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad, but he won't Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope He knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's Back to the lab again, yo! This whole rhapsody Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
